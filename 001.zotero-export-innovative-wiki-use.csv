These projects take advantage of the advancement of digital technologies to enable local communities to manage their ICH, in tune with the deprofessionalisation of heritage practices. However, additional work is needed to overcome some of the barriers that are emerging in these endeavours, especially related to long-term sustainability and the technical knowledge required. The thesis follows the progress of two case studies that used wikis to enable participation in the documentation of cultural heritage. Using action research, the researcher introduced or tried to improve the use of wikis in these case studies. The ﬁrst case study involved a Scottish heritage wiki at a national level, but the project ran into many problems. Although the software was appropriate for facilitating public engagement, the research showed that the emphasis should be put on local heritage rather than national, and that face-to-face interactions providing engagement and training activities should have been more widely used as well. The second case study was the analysis of a wiki dedicated to collating and documenting the ICH of the Isle of Jura, Scotland. The problems encountered in this case study point to the presence of pre-existing conﬂicts and the contentious nature of heritage on the island as barriers to the project. The main argument of the thesis is that involvement in digital cultural heritage can enhance community empowerment, but that this depends upon social dimensions of community cohesion and engagement as well as technical knowledge of the software and technologies involved.","2017","2021-04-10 02:21:15","2021-04-10 02:21:15","2021-04-10 02:21:15","","","","","","","Using wikis for intangible cultural heritage in Scotland","","","","","University of Aberdeen","","eng","","Ph.D.","","","ethos.bl.uk","","Accepted: 2017","","C:\Users\danie\Zotero\storage\LHU9C273\OrderDetails.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim is not so much to check the defined requirements but to ensure that the software satisfies the customer’s needs. Agile methodologies put stringent demands on UAT, if only for the frequency at which it needs to be conducted due to the iterative development of small product releases. In this setting, traditional in-person meetings might not scale up well. Complementary ways are needed to reduce the costs of developer-customer collaboration during UAT. This work introduces a wiki-based approach where customers and developers asynchronously collaborate: developers set the UAT scaffolding that will later shepherd customers when testing. To facilitate understanding, mind maps are used to represent UAT sessions. To facilitate engagement, a popular mind map editor, FreeMind, is turned into an editor for FitNesse, the wiki engine in which these ideas are borne out. The approach is evaluated through a case study involving three real customers. First evaluations are promising. Though at different levels of completeness, the three customers were able to complete a UAT. Customers valued asynchronicity, mind map structuredness, and the transparent generation of documentation out of the UAT session.","2017-11-01","2021-04-10 02:22:09","2021-04-10 02:22:09","2021-04-10 02:22:09","212-229","","","133","","Journal of Systems and Software","User acceptance testing for Agile-developed web-based applications","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\danie\Zotero\storage\QLN3V9PJ\S016412121730002X.html","","","Agile development; Test automation; User acceptance testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With adoption of EHRs came the promise of improved efficiency, higher-quality care, and lower costs. Unfortunately, some clinicians are now spending twice as much time on documentation as they spend seeing patients, and the documentation paradigm of problem-oriented medical records is contributing to this imbalance. It is time to consider new innovations. The collaborative wiki format offers many opportunities to ease the burden of documentation as well as to increase the usefulness of the recorded clinical data. Wikis support multiple authorship, have built-in features to track edits and changes, allow for contextual linkages (e.g., linking medical problems to their treatment), and support new technologies such as application programming interfaces, which allow for safe and secure exchange of information. In this Perspective, the authors describe the rationale for considering this approach to clinical documentation and propose a pilot to learn about its effectiveness. They believe wiki-based documentation will become increasingly attractive, especially as new legislation and directives from policymakers seek to reduce the crushing documentation burden and as the U.S. health care system transitions from an episode-based payment structure to a value-based, outcomes-focused system.","2019-05","2021-04-10 02:22:46","2021-04-10 02:22:46","2021-04-10 02:22:46","645–650","","5","94","","","It’s Time to Wikify Clinical Documentation","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","journals.lww.com","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Information security is an organization-wide common mission; whose success strongly depends on efficient knowledge sharing. For this purpose, semantic wikis have proved their strength as a flexible collaboration and knowledge sharing platforms. However, there has not been notable academic research on how semantic wikis could be used as information security management platform in organizations for improved cyber resilience. In this paper, we propose to use semantic wiki as an agile information security management platform. More precisely, the wiki contents are based on the structured model of the NIST Special Publication 800-53 information security control catalogue that is extended in the research with the additional properties that support the information security management and especially the security control implementation. We present common uses cases to manage the information security in organizations and how the use cases can be implemented using the semantic wiki platform. As organizations seek cyber resilience, where focus is in the availability of cyber-related assets and services, we extend the control selection with option to focus on availability. The results of the study show that a semantic wiki based information security management and collaboration platform can provide a cost-efficient solution for improved cyber resilience, especially for small and medium sized organizations that struggle to develop information security with the limited resources.","2016-08-17","2021-04-10 02:41:04","2021-04-10 02:41:04","2021-04-09","1–8","","","","","","","OpenSym '16","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","C:\Users\danie\Zotero\storage\BWN87FXH\Nykänen and Kärkkäinen - 2016 - Supporting Cyber Resilience with Semantic Wiki.pdf","","","Cyber resilience; Information security management; Risk management; Semantic wiki","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the wide spread use of wikis, many users still do not understand what a wiki is, how it is used, or how to apply it to their needs. The myriad uses for wikis and figuring out how to use them can be overwhelming. At SUNY Geneseo, we use two different wikis to address two different technical requirements. One wiki is for internal documentation used by Computing & Information Technology (CIT). The other wiki is a college-wide wiki system where any department or individual can have a wiki for whatever subject they wish. The college ¬wide wiki system was installed two years ago and has many uses such as documentation, collaborative writing, committee work, communication, and education.

However, the costs to use an educational game design with efficient delivery of the game/course plan can be problematic. Our first objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification by using existing techniques (e.g., simple HTML-based games) and readily available collaborative tools (e.g., wikis) from a typical learning management system (LMS), such as Blackboard. Our second objective was to examine students' attitudes toward gamification (e.g., perceived usefulness). An online survey was given to 80 graduate students who took an entry-level biostatistics course from 2015 to 2017 at a midwestern university in the United States. Our study was conducted using an experimental group (class with implementation of gamification) and control group (class without implementation of gamified activities) that were randomly selected from graduate-level statistics courses. A Welch's independent ""t""-test revealed a significant difference (p < 0.001) in the mean exam scores of the experimental and control groups. The difference favored classes with gamification. The findings suggest that using built-in LMS tools to design gamified learning activities can enhance students' academic performance and the competencies gained, as well as provide more diversified learning methods and motivation, and offer easy modifications for different learning needs.","2018-09","2021-04-10 02:52:41","2021-04-10 02:52:41","2021-04-10 02:52:41","41-54","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ERIC","","Publisher: Online Learning Consortium, Inc","","C:\Users\danie\Zotero\storage\LLYEY2SS\Chen et al. - 2018 - Gamify Online Courses with Tools Built into Your L.pdf; C:\Users\danie\Zotero\storage\DKEHYDVI\eric.ed.gov.html","","","Academic Achievement; Active Learning; Biology; College Students; Computer Games; Control Groups; Costs; Educational Games; Graduate Students; Independent Study; Instructional Effectiveness; Learning Activities; Management Systems; Online Courses; Self Determination; Statistics; Student Attitudes; Student Motivation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Without such discussions, interventions that prolong life at the cost of decreasing its quality may be used without appropriate guidance from patients. Objectives To adapt an existing decision aid about CPR to create a wiki-based decision aid individually adapted to each patient’s risk factors; and to document the use of a wiki platform for this purpose. Methods We conducted three weeks of ethnographic observation in our ICU to observe intensivists and patients discussing goals of care and to identify their needs regarding decision making. We interviewed intensivists individually. Then we conducted three rounds of rapid prototyping involving 15 patients and 11 health professionals. We recorded and analyzed all discussions, interviews and comments, and collected sociodemographic data. Using a wiki, a website that allows multiple users to contribute or edit content, we adapted the decision aid accordingly and added the Good Outcome Following Attempted Resuscitation (GO-FAR) prediction rule calculator. Results We added discussion of invasive mechanical ventilation. The final decision aid comprises values clarification, risks and benefits of CPR and invasive mechanical ventilation, statistics about CPR, and a synthesis section. We added the GO-FAR prediction calculator as an online adjunct to the decision aid. Although three rounds of rapid prototyping simplified the information in the decision aid, 60% (n = 3/5) of the patients involved in the last cycle still did not understand its purpose. Conclusions Wikis and user-centered design can be used to adapt decision aids to users’ needs and local contexts. Our wiki platform allows other centers to adapt our tools, reducing duplication and accelerating scale-up. Physicians need training in shared decision making skills about goals of care and in using the decision aid.

One of the biggest challenges in a long-running big data platform for smarter cities lies in the real capacity not only to drill into the data, but also, and most importantly, to leverage existing social and geographical ties between all main actors of local communities, which range from normal citizens and people to economy stakeholders, non-profit and social organizations, and government and administrative staff. The platform should let them use (and disclose) among themselves those pieces of information they do not want to publish globally (e.g., on Facebook and Google), but would be willing to share and interweave locally (e.g., through an easy-to-use community portal). In addition, if the advent of Web 2.0 technologies simplified both the consumption and the production of new contents (e.g., through highly interactive wiki-like pages), they considerably enable additive services. A notable example is the metering of the digital footprint and traces left by users as they interact with these platforms, useful to further enhance the user experience by providing automatically adapted mashups of local community services/data. We describe how to exploit these socio-technical aspects by integrating them in a new semantic-enabled big data platform specifically designed for the local community smart city scenario called LocalFocus. The article also reports some experimental results collected with a first in-the-field deployment of the LocalFocus in Imola, namely, the ImolaInRete community portal, which has already involved more than 800 citizens since its launch in January 2017.","2018-07","2021-04-10 03:43:42","2021-04-10 03:43:42","","116-123","","7","56","","","LocalFocus","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Communications Magazine","","C:\Users\danie\Zotero\storage\AEEP66T7\Bergamini et al. - 2018 - LocalFocus A Big Data Service Platform for Local .pdf; C:\Users\danie\Zotero\storage\VNWXMKMM\8419190.html","","","Big Data; Data visualization; Information services; Internet of Things; Smart cities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Not only does it make scientific reading simple and easy (by connecting the involved concepts used in the scientific articles to their Wikipedia explanations) but also improves the overall quality of the article. In this paper, we present a novel metapath based method, WikiM, to efficiently wikify scientific abstracts - a topic that has been rarely investigated in the literature. One of the prime motivations for this work comes from the observation that, wikified abstracts of scientific documents help a reader to decide better, in comparison to the plain abstracts, whether (s)he would be interested to read the full article. We perform mention extraction mostly through traditional tf-idf measures coupled with a set of smart filters. The entity linking heavily leverages on the rich citation and author publication networks. Our observation is that various metapaths defined over these networks can significantly enhance the overall performance of the system. For mention extraction and entity linking, we outperform most of the competing state-of-the-art techniques by a large margin arriving at precision values of 72.42% and 73.8% respectively over a dataset from the ACL Anthology Network. In order to establish the robustness of our scheme, we wikify three other datasets and get precision values of 63.41%-94.03% and 67.67%-73.29% respectively for the mention extraction and the entity linking phase.","2017-06-19","2021-04-10 04:55:58","2021-04-10 04:55:58","2021-04-09","21–30","","","","","","WikiM","JCDL '17","","","","IEEE Press","Toronto, Ontario, Canada","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","C:\Users\danie\Zotero\storage\D7TTG77Z\Jana et al. - 2017 - WikiM metapaths based wikification of scientific .pdf","","","author publication network; citation network; entity linking; mention extraction; metapath; scientific article; wikification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"47YNZK5I","journalArticle","","","A Remotely Reconfigurable IoT System using Wiki Software | Information Engineering Express","","","","","http://www.iaiai.org/journals/index.php/IEE/article/view/420","Herein, an Internet of Things (IoT) system with remotely reconfigurable gateways and wireless sensor network (WSN) nodes is presented and its applications are discussed. This IoT system consists of wiki pages, bots, (defined as remotely controlled devices), and remotely reconfigurable WSN Nodes. Each bot can be used as the gateway of the WSN if the bot was connected with it. The bots/gateways and WSN nodes of the IoT system are controlled by scripts written on wiki pages that are read by the bot/gateways, which then forward the commands contained in the scripts to the WSN nodes. Each WSN node then executes the commands, obtains the resulting sensor values, and then returns those values to the bot/gateways. The bot/gateways relay the values and write them onto the wiki page. Each bot and WSN node is flexible and reconfigurable because its behavior can be changed by the script commands written onto the wiki page. Using this IoT system, we created a measurement system to evaluate activity levels of group work in a classroom. After developing the measurement system, we found it was possible to adjust the sampling rate for obtaining sensor values simply by rewriting the script on the wiki page without directly manipulating the WSN.","","2021-04-10 07:05:32","2021-04-10 07:05:32","2021-04-10 07:05:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","www.iaiai.org","","","","C:\Users\danie\Zotero\storage\CHY5MJM6\420.html; C:\Users\danie\Zotero\storage\PVFUEE74\A Remotely Reconfigurable IoT System using Wiki So.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The user access level depends on which rights (also called permissions, user groups, bits, or flags) are assigned to accounts. There are two types of access leveling: automatic, and requested. User access levels are determined by whether the Wikipedian is logged in, the account's age and edits, and what manually assigned rights the account has. Anyone can use the basic functionalities of Wikipedia even if they are not logged in. Unless they are blocked, they may freely edit most pages. Being logged in gives users many advantages, such as having their public IP address hidden and the ability to track one's own contributions. Additionally, once user accounts are more than a certain number of days old and have made more than a certain number of edits, they automatically become autoconfirmed or extended confirmed, allowing the direct creation of articles, the ability to move pages, to edit semi-protected and extended-protected pages, and upload files. Further access levels need to be assigned manually by a user with the appropriate authority. An editor with more experience and in good standing can attempt to become an administrator, which provides a large number of advanced permissions. Many other flags for specialized tasks are also available.","2021-04-09","2021-04-10 15:30:30","2021-04-10 15:30:30","2021-04-10 15:30:30","","","","","","","Wikipedia","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","","","","Wikipedia","","Page Version ID: 1016774090","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
