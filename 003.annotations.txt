A Remotely Reconfigurable IoT System using Wiki Software

http://www.iaiai.org/journals/index.php/IEE/article/view/420
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Using this IoT system, we created a measurement system to evaluate activity levels of group work in a classroom.
- we developed an IoT ystem using wiki software [5][6][7][8][10]. This system consists of wiki pages using wiki software and bots (defined herein as remotely controlled devices).
- If a wiki is friendly to people, it will also be friendly to machines. This means that if machines can automatically read and write
data onto a wiki page, users can obtain much more in the way of beneficial information. Those users can also easily control machines through the wiki page, thereby facilitating machine-
to-people, people-to-machine, as well as machine-to-machine communication, which would make the wiki much more useful.
- In the next section, we will explain how we created an activity measurement system to evaluate group work activity in a classroom using our proposed IoT
system.

of carbohydrate-active enzymes
- Now celebrating its 10th anniversary online, CAZypedia is a successful example of dynamic, community-driven and expert-based
biocuration.
- CAZypedia arose from the idea that a more detailed and directly accessible summary of the
key research on individual CAZy families would be of significant value to glycoscience researchers, particularly highlighting the primacy
of key research discoveries in a family, and supporting the activities of all scientists interested in CAZymes.
- The MediaWiki software upon which CAZypedia relies tracks usage statistics, which are available through the Special Pages menu item.
- More conservative estimates of activity provided by Google Analytics indicate that CAZypedia access has increased to thousands of international users
per week since data recording on that utility began in the autumn of 2009 (Figure 2). Regardless of the absolute values, these data highlight
the sustained and growing value of CAZypedia to specialists and non-specialists alike.
- although CAZypedia adopts many of the general principles and rules of Wikipedia, CAZypedia draws on best-practice authoring
and editing principles of peer-reviewed, wiki-based encyclopedia such as Citizendium (available at URL http://en.citizendium.org/)
and Scholarpedia (available at URL http://www.scholarpedia.org).
- Additionally, individual
biographical pages enable readers to evaluate directly each contributor’s expertise in the field. To maintain editorial quality control,
every Family and Lexicon page in CAZypedia is overseen by a Responsible Curator, who is primarily responsible for overall content.
Responsible Curators are selected by a panel of Senior Curators based on established expertise and a willingness to participate in the active
maintenance of specific pages. In turn, Responsible Curators are tasked with recruiting and managing Authors to participate in content creation;
Responsible Curators may also contribute directly to composing page content.
- In the spirit of a community-driven resource, individuals are encouraged to self-nominate to become Responsible Curators or
Authors.

TOWARDS SMART RIYADH: RIYADH WIKI INFORMATION AND COMPLAINING SYSTEM

http://aircconline.com/ijmit/V10N2/10218ijmit06.pdf

Wikia
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The system follows the crowd sourcing
approach by allowing citizens to act as sources of data to support the government and to improve their city.
It also follows the co-design approach by being an open source platform that allows citizens to cooperate
to build the system and add new services. The system aims at enhancing citizens’ life and solving
governmental issues like transparency, trust, decision-making, and accountability in a cheap way. It is
developed as a web-based wiki system, so it can be used easily by the non-skilled citizens while allowing
skilled citizens to add new features, functionalities, and new services.
- In this paper, a crowdsourcing web-based wiki system “Riyadh Wiki Information and
Complaining System” is proposed to engage citizens in Riyadh city in Saudi Arabia.
Crowdsourcing approach has been selected as it is the most scalable approach that does not
require highly skilled citizens.
- Wikia tool has been selected for the system
implementation as it is a free open source tool with useful features to reduce the development
effort.
- “Riyadh Wiki Information and Complaining System” is an initiative for the smartness of Riyadh
city. It presents a hybrid model of engagement, where the citizens can engage in the smartness of
their city by publishing Riyadh issues and data about different sectors such as health and
education sectors; in addition, citizens can add new features, functionalities and even new sectors
to the system. In other words, the system follows the crowdsourcing approach by allowing
citizens to act as sensor nodes and sources of data to support the government and to improve their
city. It also follows the co-design approach by being an open source platform that allows citizens
to cooperate to build the system and add new features and functionalities to it.
- “Riyadh Wiki Information and Complaining System” is a web-based system where citizens can
discuss, add and share data and issues in the city of Riyadh in order to publish important
information, fix issues and improve their city. The home page of the system is shown in Fig 1.
The main functions of the system are:
- To increase the scope of engagement so that it can cover large number of citizens and large
number of sectors, the system has been developed using Wiki tools so that the citizens rather than
the government will carry out the web-development process. Using Wiki, citizens can add new
sectors and share data, complains, and feedback about the different sectors in the city, and the
different services that the government provides.
- 4.3.WEB USABILITY EVALUATION
ISO defines usability as the “extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve
specified goals effectively, efficiently and with satisfaction in a specified context of use" (in ISO
9241-11) [28]”. To ensure the usability on our system, the following conditions should be
satisfied:
1. The system must operate on any device: laptop, smartphone, or tablet.
2. The system must be accessible anytime and anywhere.
3. The system must be available on different languages.
4. The system must be free of charge.
5. As the content of the system will be created by the citizens, the system should have
usability features that will facilitate their work.
6. Complaining systems must have features to facilitate adding and reinforcing complains.

LiverWiki: a wiki-based database for human liver

https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-017-1852-0

- mediawiki
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Other than assisting users in searching,
browsing, reviewing, refining the contents on LiverWiki, the most important contribution of LiverWiki is to allow the
community to create and update biological data of liver in visible and editable tables. This integrates newly produced
data with existing knowledge. Implemented in mediawiki, LiverWiki provides powerful extensions to support
community contributions.
- Fortunately, wiki-based biological databases have received
a great deal of attention in recent years [7]. The
idea of a wiki on gene function was first proposed based
on the report that wikipedia comes close to Britannica
in terms of the accuracy of its science entries [8]. Later
on, there has been an significant increase in the construction
domain-specific wiki-based databases [9–26].
- LiverWiki supports community searching, browsing,
reviewing, refining, and creating liver-related data, which
allow newly produced data to be rapidly integrated with
existing data through community curation. Flexible internal
links are provided to demonstrate the relations between
genes, proteins, pathways and diseases. Powerful
external links are used for direct access to external databases.
- As the user group continues to
grow, user participation is be included to ensure the accuracy
of the information on LiverWiki following the
wiki model: the quality of information is ensured and
improved by multiple users reviewing and refining the
same content [21]. When the user group grows bigger,
pages/tables created by users are to be reviewed by peers
in co-editing manners to ensure the accuracy of the information
on the pages/tables.
- Users can create new pages
using pre-defined templates. LiverWiki offers 11 types of
page creators for registered users, which are shown in
Fig. 6. 
- Other functionalities
A user-friendly web interface is provided for users to
easily search or browse LiverWiki.'
- In an academic setting, trust of peers is relatively
high. A single account can be created for a principal
investigator who can create accounts for their
students. This approach for account creation relieves the
burden of having to create all accounts from a single
user.

Development of a decision aid for
cardiopulmonary resuscitation and invasive
mechanical ventilation in the intensive care
unit employing user-centered design and a
wiki platform for rapid prototyping

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0191844

Dokuwiki 

https://www.wikidecision.org/
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wikis and user-centered design can be used to adapt decision aids to users' needs and local
contexts. Our wiki platform allows other centers to adapt our tools, reducing duplication and
accelerating scale-up. Physicians need training in shared decision making skills about goals of
care and in using the decision aid.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend shared decision making (SDM) to facilitate discussions
about goals of care and the desirability of aggressive life-sustaining interventions [9].
SDM involves health professionals and patients making decisions together based on the best
available evidence, health professionals' experience, and patients' values and preferences [10±
12]. Decision aids (DAs) can help clinicians engage in SDM with their patients [12]. Routinely
engaging patients and their family members in discussions about both options (i.e. forgoing or
pursuing life-sustaining interventions) recognizes patient autonomy, improves the experience
of dying, and reduces family distress [13]. Although DAs about life-sustaining interventions
exist and can be found online on websites such as the A to Z Inventory of Decision Aids [14],
these DAs are not universally used in hospitals around the world. Lack of adaptation

However, to the best of
our knowledge, wikis have never been used to engage knowledge users in adapting existing
DAs to local contexts and to the specific needs of users (patients and clinicians) [18]. For these
reasons, our primary objective was to engage end-users in adapting an existing decision aid
about CPR to create a locally-adapted wiki-based decision aid about goals of care that could be
individually tailored to a patient's risk factors. The secondary objective was to document the
use of a wiki platform for this purpose.

Phase I: Needs assessment
Phase II: Prototype development
The Good Outcome
Following Attempted Resuscitation (GO-FAR) clinical prediction rule estimates the likelihood
of neurologically intact survival after in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation

Using Dokuwiki and its GNU General Public Licence, we created a
wiki that presented our project and archived the different versions of our DA for future use
and adaptation to other contexts.

The wiki was used instead as a knowledge management and
dissemination platform and for programming the online GO-FAR prediction rule, which
became an online complement to the DA that intensivists could use at their discretion.

Documenting the use of a wiki platform for adapting DAs

we
used user-centered design methodology to create a new DA adapted to the local context and
the needs of patients and clinicians in an ICU in Quebec, Canada. As an adjunct, we combined
the GO-FAR outcome prediction calculator with visual risk representation software to enable
physicians to quickly tailor visual representations to individual patients to explain their
chances of survival with a good neurological outcome after attempted CPR for in-hospital cardiac
arrest.

Data Descriptor: A global reference
database of crowdsourced cropland
data collected using the Geo-Wiki
platform

10.1038/sdata.2017.136

geo-wiki
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background & Summary
The spatial extent of cropland has been mapped from remote sensing via many different initiatives as
part of global land cover mapping activities, e.g., GLC-20001, MODIS land cover2, GlobeLand303 and
the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) of the European Space Agency4. Despite the availability of these
and many other products, large spatial disagreement on the location and distribution of cropland still
exists5–7.

In addition to validation, the
data presented here also represent a valuable training tool that can be used to develop new land cover or
cropland extent maps as well as to train algorithms to produce remote sensing-based products14,15

Once a participant was
registered and logged on, he/she could see a sample location where a semi-transparent 300 × 300m frame
subdivided in 25 grid cells is superimposed on Google Maps imagery (indicated by A in Fig. 2). Users
were then asked to click (i.e., shade in yellow) all grid cells covered by more than 50% cropland

The primary use of this reference data set is to validate global cropland maps generated using remote
sensing that range from 60 to 300m in resolution. More specifically, the data allows for an extensive
spatially explicit validation of the cropland layer due to the rich amount of reference data.

Supporting Cyber Resilience with Semantic Wiki

10.1145/2957792.2957803

semantic wiki
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In any case, to manage the information security, organizations need to recognize all valuable assets, identify threats and risks, respond to risks by appropriate controls, and finally monitor the development [24, 31]. Semantic wikis provide excellent platform and infrastructure for the documentation and maintenance of this valuable information.

Wiki platforms are becoming more and more popular knowledge and information management tools especial for intra-organizational collaboration to facilitate knowledge management between coworkers [20, 22]. Semantic MediaWiki (SMW) extends basic wiki platforms with the ability to represent, query and manage structured information [22]. Wikis, especially with the semantic extensions, have proven their strengths as knowledge sharing and collaboration platforms for wide variety of purposes especially in software engineering, systems management, and knowledge base systems [26]. Hence, SMW can be seen as a potential collaboration platform for cyber security risk management and associated catalogues for SMEs.

The main purpose of the current research efforts is to assess, by constructing a prototype, whether it is possible to use semantic wiki as platform for information security knowledge base to improve cyber resilience and risk management processes of especially SMEs.

We propose to use the semantic wiki to provide a platform of existing common information and cyber security information, which can be used as a technical tool for organizations own risk management processes. The proposal consists of initial asset, risk, and security control data provided in the semantic wiki as well as new functions implemented to wiki for common actions performed as part of risk management process.

Gamify Online Courses With Tools Built Into Your
Learning Management System (LMS)
to Enhance Self-Determined and Active Learning

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In other words,
a wiki can be a collaborative tool that allows students to create web contents (e.g., web pages,
texts, and tables). For the present study, we used the built-in wiki setting in the LMS to create
an editable contingency table (i.e., a 4 x 4 table [bingo] or a 6 x 5 table [Jeopardy]), where each
cell contained a short essay or statistical calculation question.

One of the special characteristics of the gamified activities was to have students submit
their answers in a game setting, such as online bingo or Jeopardy. Both gamified activities
required players to provide their answers into a wiki-based table through an online course LMS.
By default, only one student in a course could log in to edit the wiki table, while everyone else
would have their access to the wiki table blocked until the student logged out. This mechanism
created a natural first-come, first-choice environment, which fits the competition and challenge
element in the gamification design. Most
